nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API keys properly managed via environment variables. No sensitive data stored in summaries. Graceful error handling prevents information leakage."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Token estimation is efficient (O(n) complexity). Summarization triggers appropriately (every 10 messages). Claude API calls are async and non-blocking. Token budget management excellent with 70%/90% thresholds."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent graceful degradation on Claude API failures. State immutability enforced throughout. Comprehensive error handling with proper logging. All edge cases covered in tests."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure with excellent documentation. Helper functions well-organized and reusable. Comprehensive operations guide for troubleshooting. Configuration tuning clearly documented."
